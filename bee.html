<h2>Urban Beekeeping </h2>
How to Build Your Own Hive
	<h3>1) Bee on the Right Side of Your Local Laws</h3>
	Check any regulations or ordinances in your community concerning beekeeping. Make sure you meet your stateâ€™s regulatory requirements concerning the liscence you need to beekeep. Don't forget to get your hives approved.

	<h3>2) Where to Put Your Behive</h3>
	A Secluded part of a Garden  
	If you live in a city and happen to have you're own garden, this is a perfect spot. If not, check to see if there is a community garden close by or if aneighbor is willing to let you use theirs.

	<h4>Balcony or Roof</h4>
	If you live in an aprtment with an unused balcony or roof, you can place your hive here

	<h4>Indoors</h4>
	Although this is not the most traditoinal method, it is still possible. The hives are usually attached to an wall, with come sort of small opening that allows the bees to get outside. 

	<h3>3) Get Supplies</h3>
	These materials  are necessary for builing a urban bekeeping. 
	*Some listed below apply more to honey bees.
	<br>
	<h4>Hive Box</h4> Find a box that suits your enviroment best.
	<br>
	<h4>Hive Stand</h4> This is important, as raises the hive above the ground. This gives provides sufficient air flow and ventelation, preventing moisture damage to the hive.
	<br>
	<h4>Bottom Board</h4> The hive sits on a bottom board, which can be either mesh ot solid. Solid boards heep the hive warm during the winter and prevents ants, a predator to bees, from entering the hive. Mesh boards prevent an accumilation of mites (wich fall off of bees when they clean themselves) on the bottom of the hive.</h4>
	<br>
	<h4>Deep Hive Body</h4> This internal frame houses the bees and holds the honeycombs.
	<br>
	<h4>Frames</h4> Bees use these foundations (which can be wooden or plastic) to build their honeycombs.
	<br>
	<h4>Shallow Chamber</h4> This chamber collects the surplus of honey.
	<br>
	<h4>Inner and Outer Cover</h4> These help with air circulation.
	<br>
	<h4>Feeders</h4> Bees cannot collest enough nectar during the winter, so feeders provides them with the necessary sugar and water needed to sustain themselves.
	<br>
	<h4>Smoker</h4> This is an extremely helpful yool that calms the bees down, making it easier to harvest honey.
	<br>
	<h4>Frame Lifter</h4> This helps with getting the frames out of the hives.
	<br>
	<h4>Bee-Proof Suit</h4> This gives you with protection when handling the bees or their habitat.

	<br>
	<h4>A swarm of Bees with a Queen</h4> You obviously cannot have a beehive without bees. Make sure there is a queen so that bees can continue to be produced and you can have a flourishing and thriving hice at all times.
