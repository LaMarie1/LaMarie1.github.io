	<h2>Bees in the Media</h2>
	There are so many famous bees in the media, we just had to take the time to recognize their hard work and achievement.
	<h3>Barry B. Benson</h3>
	Academy award nominated actor, comedian, and star of perhaps one of the most poigant and influence films of our generation, <i>The Bee Movie</i> (2007), Barry is a honeybee who falls in love with a human woman named Vanessa and generated a lot of buzz as he taught the world to accept <i>bee</i>stiality. 
	<h3>The Honey Nut Cheerios Bee</h3>
	Beloved mascot of the most well known Cheerios brand, this bee, known in some hives as BuzzBee, has been promoting healthy eating and a love for bees in the minds of children since 1979. 
	<h3>BumbleBee Man</h3>
	This random side character from <i>The Simpsons</i> never takes off his bee costume is the star of a Spanish-language TV show where he performs slapstick comedy. His parents died playing paintball. He is a true hero and we salute him.
