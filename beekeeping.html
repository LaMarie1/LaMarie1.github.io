<h2>Buying Bees</h2>
<h3> Package Bees or Nucleus Hive</h3>
<h4>Package Bees</h4> 
<p>A package of bees will most likely contain a queen and some workers. In addition, the package will have a feeder with sugar syrup. It is important to note that with package bees, the worker bees and the queen are unaccustomed to each other, which could pose a problem with bee integration with the queen.</p>

<h4>Nucleus Hive</h4> 
<p> A nucleus hive is a little different. Instead of just bees, ordering a nucleus hive will give you a half-size colony, which includes frames of honeycomb, honey, worker bees, a queen, and baby bees. There are different sizes of nuclei, however most common is a 5 frame nuc, which contains 5 frames of honeycomb, hence the name. Pros to a nucleus hive are that all the bees are accustommed to each other and their comb environment, meaning that the bees will be able to focus on honey production over setting up a comb for them to live in.

<h3>What to buy</h3>
<p>Overall, nucleus hives are better for beginners and aspiring beekeepers, due to the the bees are all in the comb together, leading to less work needed to "set-up" the colony. However, if cost is a big factor for you, package bees have generally substantially less cost over a nucleus hive. </p>
<h3>Where and When to buy</h3>
<p> <a href="https://phillybeekeepers.org/buying-bees/" target="_blank">The Philadelphia Beekeepers Guild </a>is a great resource for listings by local sellers and is updated frequently. The best season to buy bees in is in the spring, just as the weather is warming up. This gives the bees the maximum amount of time to prepare for the cold winter. According to Philadelphia Beekeepers Guild, there are no current restrictions on beekeeping in Philadelphia, so feel free to "bee" a beekeeper if you would like!</p>
